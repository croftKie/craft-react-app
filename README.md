<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Craft-React-App is a command line tool for quickly creating the skeleton of a React application. By following the prompts you can include a GitHub repo as wel as common ReactJS tools such as Redux and Router. Once selected, the CLI will create a bespoke application structure for you.

Key Points:

- 100% written in TypeScript.
- Allows you to customise your React project.
- No need to remember lists of command line commands.

If you have any tools or additions you would like to see included in the CLI, let me know via the links above! :)
